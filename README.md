## Lyrics

```
raised in the cold 
you know i sold my soul (aaaaaaaaah scream)
pinned to the cross 
i spill my only words to date
it's death i date

follow me to the light
never enough of open doors
i reach for the handles torn
will there be some _____- to grasp


crushed all the bones to naysayers 
it's the bass that i'm drop
brushed with the nails, what you saying
it doesn't make sense

```
