## Lyrics

```
raised in the cold 
you know i sold my soul aah
pinned to the cross 
i spill my only words to date
it's death i hate
it fills me with rage
(withness to dying light) against the dying of light
again and again and again

follow me, cradle me to the light
never enough of open doors
i reach for the handles torn
will there be some _____- to grasp - mourn


crushed all the bones to naysayers will mourn
it's the bass that i'm drop
brushed with the nails, what you saying
it doesn't make sense to us

```
